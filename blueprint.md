# Retro Shooter Game Blueprint

## Overview

A simple and fun retro-style airplane shooting game with a modern sci-fi aesthetic.

## Implemented Features

*   **Mouse Control:** The player controls the airplane by moving the mouse left and right. Projectiles are fired using the spacebar or by clicking the mouse.
*   **Enemies:** Enemies are periodically generated at the top of the screen and move downwards.
*   **Projectiles:** The player can fire projectiles to destroy enemies.
*   **Power-Ups:**
    *   **Rapid Fire:** A yellow, glowing orb that temporarily increases the player's firing rate.
    *   **Shield:** A blue, glowing orb that provides a temporary shield, protecting the player from one hit.
*   **Collision Detection:** The game detects collisions between projectiles and enemies, as well as between the player and enemies/power-ups.
*   **Scoring:** The score increases by 100 points for each enemy destroyed.
*   **Game Over:** The game ends when the player collides with an enemy without a shield.
*   **Sound Effects and Music:** The game includes placeholders for background music and sound effects.

## Style and Design

*   **Dynamic Video Background:** The game features a dynamic, looping video of a cosmic scene, creating an immersive and visually stunning environment.
*   **Neon Glow Aesthetics:** All game elements, including the player, enemies, projectiles, and power-ups, are rendered with a bright neon glow effect.
*   **Sci-Fi Ship Design:** The player and enemy ships are represented by sleek, triangular shapes that fit the modern sci-fi theme.
*   **Vibrant Color Palette:** The color scheme uses a dark background with vibrant neon colors: cyan for the player, magenta for enemies, yellow for projectiles, and distinct colors for each power-up.
*   **Scrolling Starfield:** During gameplay, a background of scrolling stars is rendered on the canvas to give the player a sense of flying through space.
*   **UI:** The user interface is clean and stylized with neon fonts and borders.

## Future Plans

*   **Levels and difficulty:** Introduce different levels with increasing difficulty and new enemy types.
*   **High score:** Implement a high score system to save the player's best performance.
*   **Boss battles:** Add challenging boss battles at the end of each level.
*   **Sound Design:** Integrate a full suite of sci-fi sound effects and a synthwave soundtrack.
