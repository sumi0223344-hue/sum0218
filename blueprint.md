# Retro Shooter Game Blueprint

## Overview

A simple and fun retro-style airplane shooting game.

## Implemented Features

*   **Mouse Control:** The player controls the airplane by moving the mouse left and right. Projectiles are fired using the spacebar or by clicking the mouse.
*   **Enemies:** Enemies are periodically generated at the top of the screen and move downwards.
*   **Diverse Enemy Types:** The game includes two types of enemies: one that moves straight down and another that moves in a zig-zag pattern.
*   **Projectiles:** The player can fire projectiles to destroy enemies.
*   **Power-Ups:**
    *   **Rapid Fire:** Temporarily increases the player's firing rate.
    *   **Shield:** Temporarily protects the player from enemy collisions.
*   **Collision Detection:** The game detects collisions between projectiles and enemies, as well as between the player and enemies.
*   **Scoring:** The score increases by 100 points for each enemy destroyed.
*   **Game Over:** The game ends when the player collides with an enemy, and the player can restart the game.
*   **Sound Effects and Music:** The game includes background music, as well as sound effects for shooting, enemy explosions, and collecting power-ups.

## Style and Design

*   **Retro Aesthetics:** The game features a retro design with pixelated graphics and a classic color palette.
*   **Airplane Graphics:** The player's ship and enemy ships are rendered as simple, geometric airplane shapes (triangles). The player's ship is a vibrant cyan, while enemy ships are grayscale to distinguish them.
*   **UI:** A simple and intuitive user interface displays the score and a "Start Game" button.

## Future Plans

*   **Levels and difficulty:** Introduce different levels with increasing difficulty and new enemy types.
*   **High score:** Implement a high score system to save the player's best performance.
*   **Boss battles:** Add challenging boss battles at the end of each level.
